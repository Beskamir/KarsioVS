;shader specifies the shader that should be used
shader=default

;specify the textures that should be used
; albedo = the color data, changes hue of light being absorbed
albedo=synth-rubber/synth-rubber-albedo.png
; the roughness of the texture, changes relfectivity
roughness=synth-rubber/synth-rubber-roughness.png
; metalness = how metalic the object is, changes f0
metalness=synth-rubber/synth-rubber-metalness.png
; normal = the normal data, changes normal vectors
normal=synth-rubber/synth-rubber-normal.png
; emision = the amout and hue of the light that is coming off the object
; emision=path_to_emision_map

;model specifies the model that should be used
; extension needed since it can open any model file
; would be nice if all the models were .fbx rather than .obj
;  reasoning: .fbx would only be one file while .obj has mtl
model=cube.obj

;material specifies the material that should be used
; No extension is needed. It automatically adds .txt
material=default
